My resume is a git repository.
------------------------------

I've tried a couple iterations at my resume, an XML persisted solution
way back in the 90's, a database persisted Django project
(https://github.com/ben174/bugben/tree/3.0), and now I'm trying to simplify
it by using a basic filesystem structure, with a git repository to
maintain version history.
